HotPockets is a RHOK Atlanta Dec 2011 Project

For Tracking Disease and Help throughout the world.

Blackberry or Android (Phone / Tablet) Apps allow workers to report incidences of disease to a central server.

Assumptions:
Connection May not Be there
GPS is likely available on the device, though post location submittals are likely
(a map / track of where you've been would be good)
